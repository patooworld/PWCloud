# Getting Started with SQL Operations Studio Extensibility
SQL Operations Studio has several extensibility mechanisms to customize the user experience and make those customizations available to the entire user community.  The core SQL Operations Studio platform is build on Visual Studio Code, so most of the VS Code extensibility APIs are available.  Additionally, we've provided additional extensibility points for data management specific activities.

Some of the key extensibility points are listed below.

* Visual Studio Code extensibility APIs
* SQL Operations Studio extension authoring tools

* Insights with Actions experiences
* SQL Operations Studio extensibility APIs
* Custom Data Provider APIs

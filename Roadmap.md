# Project "Carbon" Roadmap
Our goal is to make project "Carbon" an indispensable tool in your database DevOps toolset on Linux, macOS and Windows for SQL and PostgreSQL running anywhere.

As part of our planning rhythms, we typically look out 6 months, establish a set of themes we want to work towards, and then schedule work each milestone supporting those themes. Everything we do in project "Carbon" accrues to scenarios in one or more of these themes for SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Data Warehouse and PostgreSQL.

Over the next 6 months, our plan is to enable end-2-end scenarios in the 4 themes below:
- **Modern Code Workflow:** Project "Carbon" is built on top of VS Code and offers the same lightweight, keyboard focused modern code workflow experiences when working with SQL and PostgreSQL. Features such as multiple tab windows, a rich SQL editor, IntelliSense, keyword completion, code snippets & code navigation, source control integration, execute ad-hoc SQL, view & save results as text, JSON or Excel, editing data, organizing & managing a large number of connections and the familiar Object Explorer are all core experiences that users rely on in their daily database DevOps tasks. We want to make sure these core experiences are a pleasure to use in project "Carbon".

- **Test + Deploy:** On top of these core experiences, we wanted to make it easy for users to create a copy of their databases for development/testing purposes or generate scripts to automate provisioning/database seeding tasks in DevOps pipelines. We've built experiences to generate CREATE + INSERT database scripts and execute scripts against single or multiple servers. In addition, users can use their favorite command line tools (e.g. Bash, PowerShell and ssh) in the Integrated Terminal window right within the project "Carbon" user interface.

- **Provision + Monitor + Troubleshoot:** Users often create new databases and database objects (such as tables, views, stored procedures, users, logins, roles, etc.) or update existing database objects. We've made this easy & fun with smart code snippets, rich GUI experiences and deep Azure integration. Users can easily monitor their databases or quickly troubleshoot performance bottlenecks, thanks to the fully customizable management dashboard, the execution plan viewer and the Extended Events (XEvent) viewer for SQL.

- **Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery**: Every database needs a *good* disaster recovery plan to ensure business continuity. Project "Carbon" lets users create a database recovery plan appropriate for their business needs and has an intuitive experience to backup and restore databases. Our longer term goal is to allow users to configure, monitor and troubleshoot *SQL Server Always On* for their mission-critical SQL Server databases and quickly failover to a secondary database in the event of a disaster.

Project "Carbon" will ship previews every month, and we'll make progress against each of the above themes during each iteration. Our detailed sprint plan is here: <https://github.com/Microsoft/carbon/projects/1>
